## Evaluation of Prediction Models(KNN) using the Titanic Dataset 
### 1. Defining the Question

> You are presented with a data from the Titanic tradegy containing details of the passengers both the survivors and those who perished during the unfortunate Incident

> We intend to use KNN method of predicting trends in classifying various features related to the boarders and finding if they have a relationship with the rate of survival of these passenngers

### Metric for Success
 We intend to develop a model that can use the Kneighbors technique to predict the survival rate of the passengers using the provided features 
> Our model is supposed use classification method on the categorical data and we intend to achieve an accuracy of atleast 70% which should be tuned to elevates it's accuracy method 
> Tuning our model's parameters in order to improve the accuracy and reduce the error margin without overfitting

## Application of Naive Bayes as a Spam Detection Model

### 1. Defining the Question
> We have a set containg 57 features that are supposed to help predict if a message is a spam message or an actual message 
> We intend to train the model using Naive Bayes to determine it's accuracy in detecting spam messages

### Defining the Metric for Success
> The ability of the model to predict spam messages should be atleat 80% Accurate and not above 98% acccuarate this is to avoid overfitting
